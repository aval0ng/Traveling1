    <p class="centerparagraphs"> Believe it or not, I believe safe, fun, and traveling that is friendly on the paycheck
      is a skill that can be acquired and developed. There are some tried and true methods to
      planning a vacation, or a business trip etc., and these can be learned with the right mentality,
      just like math or computer science. </p>
    <h3> Little Hacks </h3>
      <h4> Find a place to visit! </h4>
      <img src="portugal.jpg" alt="Lisbon street view" width="450" id="lisbon">
      <p> This may be the hardest part of the whole process! I usually like to ask
        myself WHY I am traveling this time. Is it for tourism? Is it to relax?
        Is it to spend time with family? This will help determine what one should do
        (don't go hiking on a strenuous mountain if you're trying to relax), and
        ultimately, where one should go. </p>
      <h4> Plan at 3 months ahead (to get the best deals) </h4>
      <p>
      Planning ahead allows for time to search for flights and browse various hotel
      booking websites before settling down. This can happen over the course of weeks. </p>
      <h4> Research </h4>
      <p> Research is light and simple. Think about the weather and how that will
          affect what you pack. </p>
      <h4> Start packing a week before you leave </h4>
      <p> I'm suggesting you take your luggage out a week early for long trips, especially to rural places where it is inconvenient to access stores. Throw things into the luggage as you think of them. </p>

            <td> 1 week before </td>
            <td> 3 days before (depending on access to stores) </td>
          </tr>
